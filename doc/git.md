# Overview

There are various nice tools that support you on working with git. See the list below to get a glimpse of it.

---

# GitLens

Remembering the old comment style in legacy code bases that show how changed what and why? With [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) that is built in without distracting you with meaningless comments and massively bloated source files. Additionally you get various interesting details, like a line-wise change history, of all parts of your code that is stored within git.

There are a lot of real cool features and a lot of customization possible. So it is really Git supercharged!

# Git Graph

If you prefer a visual representation of all your branches, [Git Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph) is a really nice tool. It helps you to navigate through your repo and also displays detailed information about the single commits.

To run it, simply open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Git Graph: View Git Graph** and explore your branches.
