## Overview

Tools that support you managing and maintaining CMake projects with VS Code.

---

## Microsoft CMake Tools

To interact with CMake, the CMake Tools extension is there. It could be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools).

Especially the the CMake Quickstart feature, usable with the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) running **CMake: Quickstart**, is pretty nice to starting coding right away.

For details on how to setup, configure and build projects, see [https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/blob/develop/docs/README.md](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/blob/develop/docs/README.md)

## Support for writing CMake files

For support of writing CMakeLists files, the [CMake extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twxs.cmake) is pretty useful.
