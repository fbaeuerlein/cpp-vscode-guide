# Overview

For personal development, GitHub is a good resource for projects and a good point to store your project at. Also storing and sharing snippets is easily possible via GitHub gists.

---

# General GitHub integration

The GitHub plugin (found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github)) supports you working with issues and pull requests. Adding, changing and working with issues out of VS Code is nicely integrated.

For more details of the plugin see [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github).

# Using GitHub gists

Using gists is a nice way to share and store snippets accross projects and with the community. An extension to modify and access gists could be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kenhowardpdx.vscode-gist). To use it, you need to create a personal access token to access the gists via VS Code.
